  In developing countries and emerging economies, Internet access and infrastructure is very limited and expensive. Furthermore, the computing industry in many of these countries skipped the era of desktops and laptops and jumped straight to smartphones, tablets, and mobile devices. Both of these problems make it very difficult for engineering students and aspiring computer scientists to practice and learn programming.

  We devised a tool that enables people to work and code entirely offline on mobile devices, leveraging multiple smartphones and tablets connected in a peer-to-peer local network and working in conjunction to create a larger and more versatile development environment. HackSwarm enables both individual and collaborative coding on mobile devices without an Internet connection.
